# YTDL_py
A port of the MAUI app to python environment for better accessibility. Once MAUI app is finished, I will develop this further.

## Usage:
- replace `TEST_URL` variable with your desired link!
- change `ydlv_opts` to `ydla_opts` in appropriate function call for audio only!
- Use the PowerShell script to remove most logs from common places on any machine to protect your privacy and disasociate yourself with any illegal actions.

## Disclaimer:
- Use responsibly - Read documentation in-app and respect the content of others.
